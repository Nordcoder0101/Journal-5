Journal Day 5

My brain has pretty much been supernova'd.  Will not use the term "mind-blown" as lightly ever again.  The coding has been really
and challenging, but can attach end goals to this information.  Could see how this information could solve many problems in
the business world.  This is super exciting!

Still working through some of the programs outside of Atom.  Need to understand Git Hub and Git Bash 
coordination a little better.  Will try to pin that down this weekend.  This portion for me has been painstaking and I 
have missed some assignment submittals.  

It sucks to feel behind the curve, but am accepting that sometimes this will be the case in my chosen new profession.  Will
stick with it and do what it takes to figure this all out.
